Press the '⬆️' button at the bottom right to upload a file, you can also drag
or paste a file in order to upload a new one.

Files can be text, images or various other formats. They are limited in size
and smaller files will be stored for longer.

Be aware these files are not protected -- they are public, only share things
you want to be public. Questionable or illegal content is not permitted, logs
are kept.
